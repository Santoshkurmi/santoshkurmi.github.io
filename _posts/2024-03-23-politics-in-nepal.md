## Political System

Nepal operates under a federal democratic republic system. The country underwent significant political transformations in the early 21st century, transitioning from a monarchy to a republic.

## Recent History

- **End of Monarchy:** In 2008, Nepal abolished its centuries-old monarchy after a decade-long Maoist insurgency, declaring itself a federal democratic republic.

- **Constitutional Changes:** Nepal adopted a new constitution in 2015, establishing a federal structure with seven provinces. However, the implementation of the federal system has faced challenges, including disputes over the delineation of provincial boundaries.

## Major Political Parties

- **Nepali Congress:** One of the oldest political parties in Nepal, the Nepali Congress has traditionally been associated with the center-left and has played a significant role in Nepal's political landscape since the country's transition to democracy.

- **Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) (CPN-UML):** A major communist party in Nepal, CPN-UML has had a strong presence in Nepali politics. It has formed alliances and coalitions with other parties to govern at the federal and provincial levels.

- **Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre):** Formed as a result of the Maoist insurgency, this party played a crucial role in the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic. It has since participated in coalition governments and merged with CPN-UML to form the Nepal Communist Party.

## Current Challenges

- **Political Instability:** Nepal has witnessed frequent changes in government, with coalitions forming and breaking apart frequently. This has led to challenges in policy implementation and governance.

- **Ethnic and Regional Tensions:** Despite the federal structure aimed at addressing ethnic and regional disparities, tensions persist, particularly regarding the representation and autonomy of various ethnic groups and provinces.

- **Corruption:** Corruption remains a significant challenge in Nepal, affecting various aspects of governance and hindering the country's development.

Despite these challenges, Nepal continues its journey towards consolidating its democratic institutions and addressing the diverse needs of its population.
